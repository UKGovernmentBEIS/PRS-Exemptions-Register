<h3 class="heading-medium">Important information about Green Deal Advice Reports</h3>
<p>A Green Deal Advice Report shows how a household uses energy currently; recommends ways of making a home more energy efficient; and the amount of money that could be saved from a specific combination of Green Deal improvements.</p>
<p>You may have access to any Green Deal Advice Report on this register if you have its reference number and you have consent from the Report's owner to view it. You may also save and print a copy of it where you have consent from the Report's owner to do so. You can obtain the reference number from the Green Deal Assessor who produced it or from the Report's owner. </p>

<p>If you are not the owner of the Green Deal Advice Report, you are not permitted to show or allow someone else to show any Green Deal Advice Report, or any information taken from it (including a reference number) to anyone without the owner's consent. If the owner of the Green Deal Advice Report has given their consent and if you are one of the authorised Green Deal participants listed below, you may use an Occupancy Assessment for the purposes set out in the relevant Annex of the Green Deal Code of Practice (CoP) <a id="CoP" href="http://gdorb.decc.gov.uk/code-of-practice" target="_blank">(http://gdorb.decc.gov.uk/code-of-practice)</a></p>
