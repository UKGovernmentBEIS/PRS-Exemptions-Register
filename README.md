# PRS-Exemptions-Register

## Introduction

The application provides a system for Landlords and agents to register a property for an exemption under the 
_The Energy Efficiency (Private Rented Property)(England and Wales) Regulations 2015_.

[See the guidance] (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-private-rented-property-minimum-standard-landlord-guidance-documents)

The exemptions are recorded in a central database.

There are also public enquiries to enable a member of the public to find if a property has an exemption or if a penalty has been issued for a property where a property does not meet the standard and a valid exemption has not been claimed.
